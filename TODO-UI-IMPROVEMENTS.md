2. Cloud UV fixing
3. Orbital mechanics controls

### 10. Food Regrowth System Fix
- [ ] Fix food regrowth to work in all areas (not just high-capacity zones)
  - [ ] Investigate current regrowth logic in foodSystem.ts
  - [ ] Ensure regrowth rate is based on rolled maximum capacity per cell
  - [ ] Each cell should regrow toward its own max capacity
  - [ ] Low-capacity areas should still get some regrowth
- [ ] Implementation approach:
  - [ ] Store max capacity per food cell (if not already)
  - [ ] Apply regrowth formula: `current += (maxCapacity - current) * regenRate * dt`
  - [ ] Ensure even cells with capacity of 1-2 can regrow
  - [ ] Test across different biome types with varying capacities
- [ ] Verify biome multipliers affect capacity but not regrowth prevention
- [ ] Add debug visualization to confirm regrowth in all areas

## Technical Notes

### Collapsible Components
- Use React state for collapsed/expanded
- CSS transitions for smooth animations
- Consider using a shared hook for collapsible behavior

### Texture Resources
- Moon: Consider NASA's CGI Moon Kit or similar public domain resources
- Ensure textures are optimized for web (compressed, appropriate resolution)

### UV Mapping Fix
- May need to regenerate sphere geometry with better UV layout
- Consider using THREE.SphereGeometry with higher segment count
- Ensure texture.wrapS and texture.wrapT are set to THREE.RepeatWrapping

### Lighting Implementation Notes
- Terminator band: Modify atmosphere shader's scattering calculation
- Bloom: Use THREE.UnrealBloomPass from postprocessing examples
- Consider EffectComposer for managing multiple post-processing passes

### Starfield Implementation Strategy
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for efficient starfield
class StarField {
  - Use THREE.Points with BufferGeometry
  - Store positions in Float32Array
  - Use custom vertex/fragment shaders
  - Implement LOD: fewer stars when zoomed in on planet
  - Static stars, no physics simulation needed
}
```
